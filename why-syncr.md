Why Syncr?
=======

Because Rsync is powerful, complex, and scary to use on its own. Syncr utilizes Rsync's power to build a sysadmin and developer friendly toolkit.

Okay... so why Rsync?
-------

Because Rsync is super flexible and powerful, not to mention already being an industry standard for file transfers. So why reinvent the wheel when we can focus on the design of what is attached to that wheel.

y u no Windows support?
-----

Short answer: Cuz ain't nobody got time for that.

Longer answer: Windows is weird. Ruby isn't largely supported on Windows and as result isn't as stable. The development team at Layer8x is very _very_ small and we all have other obligations other than sitting in our parent's basements and hacking around with code. That's not to say we won't support Windows in the future; it's simply just not feasible at the moment. Many apologies.

Calm down. Breathe. It could very well be a Rsync glitch. Check out the [Rsync FAQ](https://rsync.samba.org/FAQ.html) and file a bug report on [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/layer8x/syncr/issues) if it's a problem with Syncr.
